# SCALA_Interview_Test
Test challenge to code solution in C++ to the given problem below: -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 10 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace.  Write a program in C++ that determines the fastest time they can cross the bridge. The entry to the program will be a yaml file that describes the speeds of each Person. In this situation there are 4 people but your program should assume any number of people can be passed in.    You will be judged on the following:  1. Strategy(s) - there are several ways to solve the problem, you can provide more than one. The goal is to show us how you think.  2. Architecture - we want to see how well you architect solutions to complex problems  3. Standards and best practices  4. Explanation - as a C++ thought leader in the organization you will be working with and mentoring other engineers. How well you can describe and explain your solution is very important.
